The President's Daily Brief (PDB/简报), sometimes referred to as the President's Daily Briefing, is a Top Secret document produced each morning for the President of the United States. Producing and presenting the brief is the responsibility of the Director of National Intelligence, whose office is tasked with fusing intelligence from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), the National Security Agency (NSA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and other members of the U.S. Intelligence Community. <br><br>

The PDB is intended to provide the president of the United States with new international intelligence warranting attention and analysis of sensitive international situations. The prototype of the PDB was termed the President's Intelligence Check List; the first was produced by CIA officer Richard Lehman at the direction of Huntington D. Sheldon on June 17, 1961.
Although the production and coordination of the PDB was a CIA responsibility, other members of the U.S. Intelligence Community reviewed articles (the "coordination" process) and were free to write and submit articles for inclusion.
While the name of the PDB implies exclusivity, it has historically been briefed to other high officials. The distribution list has varied over time, but has always or almost always included the Secretaries of State and Defense and the National Security Advisor. Rarely, special editions of the PDB have actually been "for the President's eyes only," with further dissemination of the information left to the President's discretion.<br><br>
Production of the PDB is associated with that of another publication, historically known as the National Intelligence Daily, that includes many of the same items but is distributed considerably more widely than the PDB.<br><br>
The Evolution of the President's Daily Brief<br><br>
For more than 60 years U.S. presidents have received a daily, multi-source intelligence digest. President Harry S. Truman was the first to receive what was then known as the Daily Summary on Feb. 15, 1946. Although that first summary was much less formal than today’s product, it marked a change in the way U.S. intelligence agencies provide strategic warning and tactical insights to the nation's highest leaders. <br><br>

对未来保持谦卑是这个国家的希望<br><br>

作者：李桂文  来源：南风窗  日期：2015-10-09  


“那时候，我和乡亲们都住在土窑里、睡在土炕上，乡亲们生活十分贫困，经常是几个月吃不到一块肉。我了解乡亲们最需要什么……”在国事访美第一站西雅图，习近平主席在演讲中提及他年轻时在陕西梁家河村下乡的经历与感受。<br><br>

这是一个关于成长的故事：一个抱负远大的中国青年，从中国的最底层开始，亲身体验民生之艰，立志寻找变革之道。这个故事也提示世人，在对生活有深刻理解之前，不要总认为自己能替他人作出更英明的决定。<br><br>

我们从中看到了领导者的谦卑。谦卑地向生活学习，向群众学习，才能够深刻理解生活，理解人民，并从中汲取力量，锻炼出坚韧品质，建立自己正确的世界观，最终奠定服务于更大社会愿景的基础。
<br><br>
毫无疑问，中国正成为一个在世界上有巨大影响力的大国。大国之大，不仅在于经济之盛、军事之强，更在于责任之重、胸怀之广，能够对整个人类文明和文明福祉的增进做出更大贡献。传统中国的精神贵族们所谓“天下”，真正的标记是文明。从大国到文明大国，还要积千万跬步，必须在世界面前保持谦卑。<br><br>

谦卑是一种“自知之明”。对未知与未来世界时刻保持谦卑，将帮助我们正确认识社会文明的本质。正因为谦卑求索，才有知识的点滴积累和传承，使得今人可以实现远超一己之力可以达到的所知限度。<br><br>

苏格拉底说，承认我们的无知，乃是开启智慧之母。岳麓山上有一座“自卑亭”，今天的大部分游客已不能理解这一名字，它与苏格拉底中西同道――“登高必自卑”。<br><br>

承认自己的无知并不容易。科学发展的加速度，给了人们一个错觉――人类的未知范围正在无限缩小，一切皆在掌控之中。世界上有不少人，固执地认为自己掌握了“宇宙的真理”，能够控制世界，所向披靡。<br><br>

可惜，这不是真相。<br><br>

即使近几十年来互联网技术的发展，大大加速了人类知识的生产与传播速度，但相对于未知的领域，人类至今为止所掌握的知识，依然只是沧海一粟。即便全部认识了整个太阳系乃至银河系，也不过是浩瀚宇宙的一粒微尘，何况我们离这个目标尚且无限邈远。<br><br>

因此，我千万不能高估自己所知的边界。哲学家哈耶克认为，如果以为我们只须将各种于当下指导我们行动的理念付诸实施，便可以达致一种更高级的文明状态，那就显然大错特错了。我们根本不可能有能力构设出自此往后500年甚或50年的文明的状况，恰如我们中世纪的先辈或我们的祖父们无力预见到我们当下的生活样式一般。<br><br>

他说，为了避免对文明的扼杀，我们就必须否弃这样一种幻想，即我们能够经由刻意的思考而“创造人类的未来”。
<br><br>
习近平主席在联合国大会上的演讲中强调，和平、发展、公平、正义、民主、自由，是全人类的共同价值。自由是秩序的目的，秩序是自由的保障。根据上述的分析，自由，可以视为是一种能够酝酿和导向更多可能性的社会机制，这种可能性的多寡，将决定一个社会创造和创新的能力。从这个角度看，文明的发展，与一个社会的自由气息密切相关，自由的程度将决定我们能否为文明的发展提供更多的机会。
<br><br>
显然，古往今来的政治家更愿意相信控制是建立秩序的力量。在不同的历史节点，这需要我们做出衡量和决断。但我们的目标应当是尽可能地去完善或改进我们的制度，让社会活力自由生长，才能够增加做出正确预测的机遇。哈耶克的研究得出结论，人类在历史上所获得的一些最伟大的成就都源出于下述事实，即人类始终无力控制社会生活。社会生活的复杂性，决定了社会活力自由生长的重要性。各式的思想、文化和制度批判，都必须等待习惯的成型，而不是用什么刻意的设计，就能够急切地格式化他人的脑袋和生活。
<br><br>
谦卑地面对未知和未来，也将让我们获得对于自身传统的自信。因为我们深知，传统和制度，绝对不是哪一个人灵机一动设计的产物，而必然是历史长期积累和发展的结果，包含了文化与生活中许多不可认知和不可言传的因素。对于拥有强大文化传统的中国来说，这一点至关重要。<br><br>

对于中国的传统和制度的独特性，基辛格在其著作《世界秩序》中有一段生动的描述，他提到，21世纪中国的“崛起”并非新生事物，而是历史的重现。与过去不同的是，中国重回世界舞台中心，既是作为一个古老文明的传承者，也是作为依照威斯特伐利亚模式行事的现代大国。它既保持了君临“天下”的传统理念，也通过技术治国追求现代化。基辛格博士的话实际上是在劝诫某些西方人，替中国人设计未来，并且认为中国人应当和一定会按照这个设计走向未来，是不智之举。<br><br>

现在，中国的新一代领导人，已经开辟了中国未来全新的可能。对未知和未来保持谦卑，让一切社会活力自由生长，大国文明必将迎来勃发的春天。<br><br>

Early Intelligence Products<br><br>
Over the years, the daily intelligence product evolved to meet the needs of the president and his national security officials. In 1951, CIA formed the Office of Current Intelligence (OCI) to consolidate the production of current intelligence. At the time, CIA analysts were already preparing a closely held, all-source weekly intelligence publication called the Situation Summary, which helped inform then-Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) Walter B. Smith’s briefings to President Truman.<br><br>
Shortly after OCI was formed, the Daily Summary became the Current Intelligence Bulletin, first issued on Feb. 28, 1951. The Current Intelligence Bulletin would continue for several years, taking on a variety of forms and increasing in scope. In 1958, it became the Central Intelligence Bulletin (CIB) and, on the recommendation of CIA’s Inspector General, analysts began coordinating the Bulletin with other members of the Intelligence Community (IC). It was also circulated more widely to other national security principals.<br><br>
The President's Intelligence Checklist, customized to President Kennedy's specifications. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy’s aides requested a more concise summary of all-source intelligence on key issues―something small enough to fit in the president’s jacket pocket. Three days later, the President’s Intelligence Checklist (PICL) was delivered to President Kennedy, who liked it immediately. From that point forward, the PICL remained essentially unchanged until the President’s Daily Brief (PDB), crafted to President Lyndon B.  Johnson’s specifications, replaced it in 1964. <br><br>

 Today’s PDB<br><br>
CIA continued to produce the PDB until the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act was signed in 2004. This legislation created the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), which is responsible for oversight and coordination of the IC. Today, the PDB is an IC product coordinated by ODNI’s PDB staff in partnership with the CIA Directorate of Intelligence (DI)’s President’s Analytic Support Staff. It is still all-source publication that the president relies upon heavily to inform his national security decisions, and CIA analysts remain primary contributors.<br><br>
The style, format and presentation of the PDB are based on the preferences of the current president. President Barack Obama, for example, asked CIA to explore a way to deliver the PDB electronically. On Feb. 15, 2014―68 years after the first Daily Summary was published―the final hard copy edition of the PDB was printed. President Obama and other key national security policymakers now receive the PDB, six days a week, in a tablet format. <br><br>
A Look Back ... The President's First Daily Brief<br><br>
For more than 60 years US Presidents have received a daily, multi-source intelligence digest. President Harry S. Truman received his inaugural Daily Summary on February 15, 1946. Although that first summary was crude by modern standards, it marked the start of a fundamentally new mission for US intelligence: providing strategic warning to the nation's highest leaders.<br><br>
In late January 1946, President Truman wanted his new Central Intelligence Group (CIG) to solve a particularly rankling problem. As he later recalled, when he succeeded the late Franklin Roosevelt the previous year, there had been "no concentration of information for the benefit of the President. Each Department and each organization had its own information service, and that information service was walled off from every other service." Reports came to Truman from all over, with no one outside the White House evaluating the range of information collected by the US government. He wanted order imposed on this situation.<br><br>
Director of Central Intelligence Sidney Souers assembled a team, obtained cables and reports from the various departments, and forwarded the first Daily Summary within weeks of the President's tasking. That first Daily Summary was a two-page no-graphic sheet with six items. The lead was a report from the US Embassy in Paris, which said that forged "secret protocols" allegedly signed by the United States and the Soviet Union at the 1945 Yalta conference had found their way to European newspaper editors. Brief notes on Germany, Turkey, Yugoslavia, China, and French Indochina filled out that first day's news. There were no graphics, no color, and no mention of "internal security" issues, as the CIG covered only foreign intelligence matters.<br><br>
Indeed, the Daily Summary was not an "all-source" publication; its CIG editors would not receive access to signals intelligence for several more months. <br><br>
The President had not specifically authorized this type of "current intelligence" reporting when creating the CIG in January 1946, and not everyone in Washington liked the new Daily Summary. In fact, Secretary of State James Byrnes complained that it infringed on the State Department's duty to furnish the President with information on foreign affairs; he felt the point so strongly that he complained to Truman in person. <br><br>
 Byrnes lost. A Daily Summary was what President Truman wanted, and that was what he got. The publication was sent to the White House in the afternoon. Truman read it during the evening and discussed it with his senior staff the next morning.
CIG heard from a White House aide a year later that "the President considers that he personally originated the Daily, that it is prepared in accordance with his own specifications, that it is well done, and that in its present form it satisfies his requirements."  Truman wrote in his memoirs that “Here, at last, a co-ordinated method had been worked out, and a practical way had been found for keeping the President informed as to what was known and what was going on….The Director of the Central Intelligence Agency…became, usually, my first caller of the day.”<br><br>

The President's Daily Brief<br><br>
By Thomas S. Blanton  April 12, 2004 Washington, D.C., <br><br>
President Bush on Saturday, 10 April 2004, became the first sitting president ever to release publicly even a portion of his Daily Brief from the CIA. The page-and-a-half section of the President's Daily Brief from 6 August 2001, headlined "Bin Ladin Determined To Strike in US," had generated the most contentious questioning in last week's testimony by national security adviser Condoleezza Rice before the commission investigating the September 11th attacks. Dr. Rice continued to insist that the Brief did not amount to a real warning, while several commissioners seemed to think otherwise.<br><br>
These contrasting interpretations dominated the weekend's news. For example, President Bush commented on Sunday that the "PDB said nothing about an attack on America. It talked about intentions, about somebody who hated America - well, we knew that. … The question was, who was going to attack us, when and where, and with what." (Note A1) Meanwhile, the Sunday news analysis in The New York Times began with the following summary: "In a single 17-sentence document, the intelligence briefing delivered to President Bush in August 2001 spells out the who, hints at the what and points towards the where of the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington that followed 36 days later." (Note A2)<br><br>
The American people can decide for themselves about the warning quotient, now that the text of the Brief is public. Even with the text, we don't really know what the President knew and when he knew it. According to the CIA and the 9/11 commission, there were 40 other mentions of Al Qaeda or Bin Laden in the President's Daily Briefs before 9/11. Most of those presumably came during what Dr. Rice called "the threat spike" of June and July 2001. The August 6 Brief came on the downside of that spike, so the other PDB reports may be more (or less) alarming. Until these are released - and Saturday's release shows it can be done with minor deletions to protect sources - neither the American public nor the 9/11 commission can move on to the next question: "What did the President do and when did he do it?" Or, perhaps most important, how do we fix our vulnerabilities, rather than just hide them?<br><br>
But the release of the Brief raises a number of questions not addressed so far in the press coverage. One is the contrast between the now-released text and what various White House officials said about it over the past two years. A second revolves around renewed claims by the White House and the CIA that this release sets no precedent for release of similar or future information. A third points to the larger question of whether the sustained secrecy around this Brief really made our country more secure, or less so. For the moment, this updated posting includes the following:<br><br>
 The declassified page-and-a-half section of the 6 August 2001 President's Daily Brief headlined "Bin Ladin Determined To Strike in US".<br><br>
  The White House Fact Sheet titled "The August 6, 2001 PDB" released at the same time as the PDB section, in question-and-answer format.<br><br>
 The White House briefing of 10 April 2004 on the release of the PDB. In the kind of stylized exchange that typifies Washington, the two briefers were identified only as "senior administration officials." Actually, they were Jim Wilkinson, the National Security Council spokesperson, and John Bellinger, the National Security Council general counsel. Interestingly, when Mr. Wilkinson agreed to check on what President Bush said when he received the PDB (p. 4), Mr. Bellinger interrupted to say "we will not take that question, because that's not the sort of thing that we would discuss, is the interaction between the President and his briefer." Earlier in this very briefing, however, Mr. Wilkinson had spent two paragraphs discussing the PDB interaction, giving President Bush the credit for having asked the questions that prompted the preparation of this particular PDB.<br><br>
 The original White House briefing on 16 May 2002 by then-spokesman Ari Fleischer, about the PDB. CBS Evening News had broken the story on the evening of 15 May 2002 that President Bush had received a briefing only weeks before September 11th mentioning the possibility of hijacking by Bin Laden. The White House responded both in Mr. Fleischer's morning briefing, and in a special briefing by national security adviser Condoleeza Rice later on 16 May. Mr. Fleischer left the impression in this briefing that the PDB came about because the President had "asked for a compilation 汇编" of the "spike-up of information early on in the summer."<br><br>
  The White House briefing on 16 May 2002 by Dr. Rice. Dr. Rice did not mention that the title of the PDB section was "Bin Ladin Determined To Strike in US," and described the PDB as "very non-specific," "nothing really new here," "an analytic piece about methods that they had available to them," "an analytic piece that tried to bring together several threads - in 1997, they talked about this; in 1998- they talked about that; it's been known that maybe they want to try and release the blind Sheikh…"<br><br>
 The White House briefing on 17 May 2002 by Mr. Fleischer, in which he said, "The President was aware that bin Laden, of course, as previous administrations it's been well-known that bin Laden was determined to strike the United States. In fact, the label on the President's -- the PDB was, 'bin Laden determined to strike the United States.'" Within two days, the missing preposition from the title ("Strike in US") was supplied on the front page of the Washington Post. (Note A3)
 The White House briefing on 21 May 2002 by Mr. Fleischer. The third question was whether the White House would share the PDB with the Congress (it did not), in answer to which Mr. Fleischer described the PDB as "the most highly sensitized classified document in the government."<br><br>
The most contentious moments of today's nationally televised hearing of the commission investigating the September 11th terrorist attacks focused on the controversial secret intelligence briefing received by President Bush on August 6, 2001 - a top-level document called the President's Daily Brief. Commission members Bob Kerrey, Richard Ben-Veniste and Timothy Roemer each asked national security adviser Condoleezza Rice to declassify the document, and each time she ducked the direct question, telling Mr. Roemer that "I think you know the sensitivity of presidential decision memoranda."<br><br>
The White House resisted the commission for months on the question of their access to the Briefs, (Note 1) but after public pressure from the commission and victims' families, relented somewhat. Prior to today's hearing, three commission members and its staff director got to see the originals of President's Daily Briefs from the Bush and Clinton years relating to terrorism. They then wrote up a summary for their peers. (Note 2) But the direct quotes from the August 6, 2001 President's Daily Brief read into the record today, both by commission members and by Dr. Rice, point to an underlying reality - that the Brief could be declassified and released publicly simply by blacking out the sources-and-methods information. <br><br>
Perhaps the White House will take this simple step, just as it reversed its previous absolute refusal to allow Dr. Rice to testify in public. Standing in the way of this common sense approach, however, are myths and misinformation about the President's Daily Brief - put forward by the White House, CIA, and even the 9-11 commission's own chairman - that, in Mark Twain's phrase, have gone twice around the world while the truth was putting on its shoes.<br><br>
For example, each of the following italicized statements is a myth, and below the myth in plain type is the reason why.
The chair of the 9/11 commission, former New Jersey governor Thomas Kean, said that "[t]hese are documents that only two or three people would normally have access to. To make those available to an outside group is something that no other president has done in our history." (Note 3)<br><br>
Actually, ten President's Daily Briefs are in the public domain, officially declassified by the U.S. government. (Note 4) The CIA established the PDB under that name in 1964, and PDBs from the Johnson administration began to be declassified in 1985, during the tenure of President Reagan. The ten declassified PDBs contain such extraordinarily sensitive items as this one on Egypt: "Nasir, in a speech to the nation on Saturday, outlined a 'program of action' to bring about political reform. We doubt that it will amount to much." That's the whole item. Another supersensitive entry concerns the head of state of Indonesia: "Despite Sukarno's long-standing kidney ailment, for which he delays proper treatment, he has seemed quite chipper lately." Three lines of the item are blacked out since they refer to the sources of intelligence, perhaps Indonesian assets of the CIA, or communications intercepts, or maybe just the British ambassador. One of the PDBs is even published in the latest volume of the distinguished State Department documentary series, Foreign Relations of the United States.<br><br>
At the top of the 5 June 1967 PDB published by the State Department one can read the official line that these historical PDBs were "improperly declassified and released. The declassification and release of this information in no way impacts or controls the declassification status of the remainder of this PDB, other PDBs, or the PDB as a series." (Note 5)
This statement is not true, and it violates the law that says the Foreign Relations series has to be accurate and comprehensive. The actual texts of the released PDBs reveal that there was nothing improper about their declassification. There is nothing damaging to U.S. national security in these documents. The secret behind the State Department's straddle - publishing a PDB while disclaiming its own action - is that the CIA is really to blame. The PDBs began to be released under the normal historical declassification program (in 1985, 1989 and 1993) until the CIA noticed and decided to invoke the final recommendation of its notorious 1991 Task Force on Openness. The task force report (classified secret at first, until embarrassment and the Freedom of Information Act forced its release) enumerated a number of goals from greater openness, including building support for the CIA budget, of course, but the final goal on the list - one that any declassifier had to keep in mind - was to "preserve the mystique." The CIA's hard line on the PDBs is one of the many decisions in the 1990s that turned CIA's openness program into a "public relations snow job," according to the distinguished historian George Herring, who served on the CIA historical advisory panel for six years until his advocacy for greater openness, including for release of the PDBs, led the CIA to replace him with more compliant scholars. (Note 6)<br><br>
The then-White House spokesman Ari Fleischer called the PDB "the most highly sensitized classified document in the government." (Note 7)<br><br>
Here is the mystique at work. Actually, there are thousands, and perhaps even millions, of codeworded documents and compartments more highly classified than the PDB itself. These include the very items blacked out in the declassified Briefs from the Johnson years - most likely describing the specific sources of the information. Mr. Fleischer himself, only four days before this remark, had read out the headline from a particularly interesting section of the August 6, 2001 President's Daily Brief, titled "bin Laden determined to strike the United States." Interestingly, today's 9-11 commission hearing featured two misstatements about this headline. Mr. Ben-Veniste said that until today, the headline was classified (Mr. Fleischer had actually read it out in May 2002); and Dr. Rice gave the headline as including the words "inside the U.S."<br><br>
A Washington Post editorial asked," If a president's intelligence briefing is not a legitimate secret, after all, what is?" (Note 8) <br><br>
Well, legitimate secrets include information like the specifications of a weapon system, the identity of a spy who'd be shot, or the bottom line of a negotiation in progress, but these real secrets make up only a fraction of what is classified today, and rarely adorn the PDB. During the Cold War, for example, the codeword GAMMA GUPY referred to the National Security Agency ability to listen in on the radio-telephone conversations of Soviet leaders while they were driving around Moscow in their limos. (Note 9) A document that specifically described that capacity would be far more sensitive than a President's Daily Brief item that said Soviet leaders were bemoaning the grain harvest failure and thinking about firing the Ukraine party secretary.<br><br>
Vice President Cheney described the President's Daily Briefs as "the family jewels." (Note 10)<br><br>
This was an unintentionally ironic turn of phrase, since the original use of the words "family jewels" in the CIA context referred to the internal compilation of agency "horrors" put together in the early 1970s after press reports of CIA assassination plots, and use of psychotropic drugs on unsuspecting victims. The PDB is about as far away from these operational matters as you can get. It provides a tour d'horizon of world events, based on the CIA's best information, spiced up with intercepted communications and spy photos. According to the CIA's own history of its presidential briefings, roughly 40 per cent of what the PDB covers is addressed in the newspapers. (Note 11) According to Walter Pincus of the Washington Post, President Clinton complained that "most days the PDB contained material he had already read elsewhere." (Note 12) President Reagan's first national security adviser, Richard Allen, wrote that the PDB "is, at best, a form of staccato information, a news digest for the very privileged. But it is rarely predictive. In fact, some would consider it pedestrian, even anodyne." (Note 13) <br><br>
The former CIA general counsel, Elizabeth Rindskopf Parker, who admitted she was not on the distribution list, called the PDB "sacrosanct," saying, "It's something you never, ever share… It really is advising your client, the president, in the most intimate way." (Note 14)<br><br>
The President is not the CIA's "client." Even the intelligence community uses the term "customer" not "client," because the CIA is precluded from making policy recommendations to the President. The first answer on the CIA website to "frequently asked questions" says the CIA is an information provider, not a policy maker. (Note 15) The PDB is an information brief, the CIA's equivalent of Headline News, not deliberative or pre-decisional or legal advice. Many presidential briefings at least as sensitive and far more deliberative than the PDBs have reached the public domain without damage to national security or to future presidents' ability to get candid advice, ranging from declassified copies of Henry Kissinger's morning briefing for President Nixon, to verbatim quotes from briefings by CIA director William Webster and national security adviser Brent Scowcroft to President George H.W. Bush that appear in the joint Bush-Scowcroft memoir, A World Transformed. (Note 16)<br><br>
Vice President Cheney said any public release of the PDBs would make its CIA authors "spend more time worried about how the report's going to look on the front page of the Washington Post or on Fox News than they will making their best judgment and taking risk and giving us the best advice they can…." (Note 17)<br><br>
The idea that CIA analysts are trimmers, not straight-shooters, insults the CIA's professionals and turns history on its head. CIA analysts have a long and distinguished track record of bringing bad news to the White House, from pessimistic estimates on the Vietnam war to predicting the 1991 coup against Gorbachev to discounting the Niger yellowcake allegation of 2002. The record shows that the people who trim intelligence to fit official spin are the policymakers, not the CIA - as when Vice President Cheney claimed in the run up to the Iraq war that Saddam Hussein had "reconstituted" his nuclear weapons. If more of the actual CIA analysis became public, policy might well improve. In the case of Iraq, the public would have seen the numerous dissents and caveats in the underlying classified estimate - dissents and caveats largely stripped out of the publicized version, and completely missing from the Vice President's speeches.<br><br>
In the same vein as the Vice President, but less colorfully, President Bush said he opposed release of the PDBs because "[i]t's important for the writers of the presidential daily brief to feel comfortable that the documents will never be politicized and/or unnecessarily exposed for public purview. I - and so, therefore, the kind of the first statements out of this administration were very protective of the presidential prerogatives of the past and to protect the right for other presidents, future presidents, to have a good presidential daily brief." (Note 18)<br><br>
There's an equally plausible case to be made that the President is protecting himself, not the CIA analysts or future presidents, from scrutiny. The analysts, after all, provided President Bush with the August 6, 2001 PDB including the warning that Bin Laden planned to attack the U.S., and mentioned hijacked airplanes as one possibility (apparently not as suicide missiles, but the more traditional skyjack style). What did the President do with that warning? Did anything happen? None of his senior aides were present at the August 6 briefing, which took place at the ranch in Crawford, Texas. From a distance, it looks as if the warning came but they all were on vacation.<br><br>
National security adviser Condoleezza Rice described the August 6, 2001 Brief as "very vague," "very non-specific," "mostly historical," and "nothing really new here." (Note 19)<br><br>
But what about that nasty headline declassified by Ari Fleischer - "bin Laden determined to strike in U.S."? Dr. Rice can't have it both ways, that the PDB is a "very vague" document that still cannot be publicly released. The bipartisan Congressional investigation of September 11th cut to the heart of the problem. Its staff director, Eleanor Hill, reported to Congress that "According to the DCI [George Tenet], the President's knowledge of intelligence information relevant to this Inquiry remains classified even when the substance of that intelligence information has been declassified." (Note 20) This is the ultimate coverup line. In other words, even if the information is public, whether the President knew it is a fact that if released would damage national security? In fact, keeping phony secrets like this does the real damage to our security, as a declassified National Reconnaissance Office study remarked: "[C]ontinued insistence on tight security for 'open' secrets reduces overall credibility and erodes the integrity of security around the technology and the operations which still need to be protected." (Note 21)<br><br>
Defending the 9/11 commission's arrangement with the White House for limited access and summaries of the PDBs, commission director Philip Zelikow said, "Neither we nor the White House are aware of any precedent for this in the history of the republic." (Note 22) <br><br>
The declassified PDBs suggest a more appropriate precedent, in fact, the same precedent that Professor Zelikow recommended during the April 2000 meeting of the State Department's historical advisory committee, referring to the historical PDBs that CIA was refusing to release: "[I]t should be possible to redact the PDB to make it releasable... the CIA's interests could be protected with redactions… the CIA's decision to withhold the entire PDB series from release [i]s pernicious." (Note 23) Indeed.<br><br>
The PDBs - even from August 2001 - could easily be declassified by blacking out the sources and methods that are truly sensitive. This fact leads to a frightening but also empowering thought: Most of the time, Presidents really do not have much more or better substantive information than the rest of us about national security, and when they think they do, they're often wrong, as LBJ was about Vietnam, or the first-term Ronald Reagan was about the Soviet military, or George W. Bush was about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.<br><br>
But releasing the President's Daily Briefs would hold the CIA accountable for its banalities as well as its triumphs and failures. Likewise, releasing the Briefs would tell us what the President knew and when he knew it. So don't hold your breath.<br><br>
 
Background Briefing Via Conference Call on the President's PDB<br><br>
August 6, 2001 6:12 P.M. EDT <br><br>
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I think we have everyone on. This will be a background briefing. We should be referred to as senior White House officials. I will say a few things -- address a few opening issues. Then my colleague and I will take some questions. <br><br>
The document you have is a copy of the document that was prepared for the President for his August 6th President's Daily Briefing. I want to talk a little bit about, before we get into the substance, just a minute about the process of declassification. I think it's important to highlight how we came to this moment. <br><br>
This action reflects both the President's full and unprecedented support for the commission's work in the unique, historic circumstances of the 9/11 attacks. While the President has the ultimate constitutional authority over the classification of information, the Director of Central Intelligence has statutory responsibility to safeguard intelligence sources and methods, and is one of the officials to whom authority to declassify information is delegated by executive order. The President authorized, and Dr. Rice requested, that the DCI review this PDB item to determine whether, in his judgment, declassification and release of this item would damage intelligence sources and methods, and is releasable in light of the relevant provisions of Executive Order on Classification and Declassification of Information. <br><br>
The DCI has advised Dr. Rice in writing that he has made the required determination and has, in fact, declassified the PDB item. And I believe you have it. The DCI determined that three specific items of information -- the names of foreign intelligence or security services -- must be redacted in order to protect intelligence sources and methods. Those items are replaced with black on the declassified and released version of the PDB you have. <br><br>
The other redactions on the released version are the original classification of the document as "Top Secret." As the DCI's written declassification order states, this declassification and release "shall not be deemed to constitute any precedent concerning any future declassification or release of any other PDB." <br><br>
Before I get to substance, I want to take a moment to go back to how this all began. We all remember the threat spike in the summer of 2001. Although the majority of this threat reporting data dealt with threats overseas, the President asked if any of this information pointed to any attack on the United States. That's how we got to this date. <br><br>
Let me go through a few key points before I jump into the substance. I think, first, the release of this PDB should clear up the myth that's out there that somehow the President was warned about September 11th, or was warned -- or, excuse me -- was briefed on information related to September 11th. As you see this PDB contains no warning of the attacks of September 11th. This piece you have before you, this President's Daily Briefing, was not prompted by new threat information. It is a review of material that was already available. And I think it shows, if you read it closely, it shows that for the threats that were discussed in this review of material you have, that those threats were being pursued aggressively by the appropriate agencies. <br><br>
Let me go into the substance of the PDB, and then we'll take your questions. The August 6, 2001 PDB item that's titled, "bin Laden Determined To Strike In U.S.," was prepared in response to questions asked by the President about the possibility of attacks by al Qaeda inside the U.S. This article, as I said before, did not warn of the September 11th attacks. Although the PDB does refer to the possibility of hijackings, it did not discuss the possible use of planes as weapons. The PDB was based largely on background information about past terrorist attacks conducted by al Qaeda and general threats, dating back from the late 1990s. The only recent information concerning possible current activities in the PDB relate to two incidents -- and there is no information, as you'll see from the briefing materials you have and as I will get to in a second -- that there's no information that either incident was related to the acts of September 11th. <br><br>
I know you have a few key questions. I'm going to take a couple now, before we open up. One, we've been asked how was this -- or, excuse me -- why was this PDB prepared. Director Tenet has already addressed and described the genesis of this PDB, itself, in a letter he wrote to the September 11th Commission, dated March 26, 2004. This PDB item, as I said before, was prepared in response to questions President Bush asked his PDB briefer. The President had seen previous intelligence reports about possible al Qaeda threats to U.S. targets outside the U.S. And the President had asked whether any of the information pointed to a possible attack inside our country. <br><br>
When this PDB item was presented to the President on August 6, 2001, his PDB briefer told him that it was prepared in response to the President's previous questions. I know I've covered that twice. I apologize, but I wanted to make sure you got that point. <br><br>
Now, what information does this PDB item contain? The article advised the President of what was publicly already well-known, that bin Laden had a desire to attack inside the United States. I repeat, this was already publicly well-known. Bin Laden had stated publicly in 1997 and 1998 that his followers would try to "bring the fighting to America." <br><br>
Most of the information in the article that you have was an analysis of previous terrorist attacks by al Qaeda and a summary and discussion of general threat reporting, as I've said, that dated back to the late 1990s. And I would note that this draft was prepared by the CIA after consultation with an FBI analyst. <br><br>
Again, we're asked, did this PDB item include any warning of the September 11th attack, and the answer is, no. The only recent information concerning possible current activities in the PDB relates to two incidents, and as I've said before, there is no information that either incident was related to the 9/11 attacks. <br><br>
I want to talk about these two incidents because it's important that you focus on the facts of each. The first incident involved suspected recent surveillance of federal buildings in New York, as you read the PDB. This information was based on a report that two Yemeni men had been seen taking photographs of buildings at Federal Plaza in New York City. The FBI later interviewed the men and determined that their conduct was consistent with tourist activity. And the FBI's investigation identified no link to terrorism. So that's the first incident. <br><br>
The second incident involved a call made on May 15, 2001, by an unidentified individual to the U.S. Embassy in the UAE, saying that a group of bin Laden supporters was in the United States planning attacks with explosives. The caller did not say where or when the attacks might occur. And there are a few key points on this that show how aggressively this call was addressed. <br><br>
As I said, the call came in on May 17, 2001 -- excuse me, on May 15, 2001. On May 17th, 2001, the NSC's counterterrorism staff convened what you know as a CSG, the Counterterrorism Security Group. And the members of this group -- I just want to take a second to remind you -- include the State Department, Department of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Department of Justice, the FBI, and the CIA. And at this meeting, they reviewed the information that had been provided by the caller to the embassy. It's important to note that this information from the caller was also shared with customs, INS, and the FAA -- cc: the long list of agencies there. <br><br>
The PDB article advised the President, as you see, that the CIA and FBI were investigating this information. And we had no information either before or after 9/11 that connects the caller's information with the 9/11 attacks. So both those incidents, I think you see, looking at the facts, both were being and had been investigated aggressively by the appropriate agencies in a timely fashion. <br><br>
The next question that some have raised, which I just want to take on -- this PDB item states that al Qaeda members have resided in or traveled to the U.S. for years, and the group apparently maintains a support structure that could aid attacks. And you'll probably ask if this was new information and what was being done about it. I'll note that the presence of individuals associated or affiliated with al Qaeda in the U.S. was not new information. This information had been well-known to the intelligence and law enforcement communities for a number of years. The FBI was actively investigating individuals associated or affiliated with al Qaeda in the United States. And this is a fact I want to point you to that's noted it the PDB article, that the FBI had been actively investigating these individuals. <br><br>
As you also see -- and it's important you read the PDB closely -- as you also note in that article, the FBI was conducting approximately 70 full field bin Laden-related investigations. <br><br>
Now, the term you'll see in the PDB -- you'll ask, why is the term "patterns of suspicious activity" used in the PDB and what does it refer to. The CIA author of the PDB item judged, after consulting an FBI colleague, that there was suspicious patterns of activity that were worrisome, even though nothing pointed to a specific operation in a specific location. And I'll just point that out again -- nothing pointed to a specific operation in a specific location. <br><br>
In that vein, the author was concerned that one of the East African bombing defendants had told FBI officers earlier in 2001 that bin Laden would retaliate if the defendants in the trial were convicted. I'll note that four were convicted -- excuse me, four were convicted in New York on May 29th -- excuse me, let me just go back and repeat this point, because it's an important point. In that vein, the author was concerned that one of the East African bombing defendants had told FBI officers earlier in 2001 that bin Laden would retaliate if the defendants in the trial were convicted -- I noted four were convicted -- with a major attack, something the FBI interpreted to mean possibly in the United States. In addition, the CIA author understood that there had been possible recent surveillance of federal buildings in New York, which I discussed earlier. <br><br>
Except for the information relating to the possible surveillance of federal buildings in New York, which was later -- I would note, was later determined by the FBI to be consistent with tourist-related activity, the PDB item you have contained no information from FBI investigations that indicated activities relating to the preparation or planning for hijackings or other attacks within the United States. None of the information relating to the "patterns of suspicious activity" section you see was later deemed to be related to the attacks of September 11th -- important point. <br><br>
From June through September -- and this is, again, this is an important point for you to know, because you'll have questions about what was being done -- from June through September, the FAA and the FBI issued a number of warnings about the possibility of terrorist attacks. The FAA warnings, I would note, included specific warnings about the possibility of a hijacking to free imprisoned al Qaeda members inside the U.S., and the possibility of attacks in response to law enforcement actions against al Qaeda members. <br><br>
I addressed before the question about why information has been redacted. And that's just to protect the names of foreign governments that have provided information to our government. <br><br>


<a href= "link09.html">美国亚裔崛起了吗？</a><br><br>
<a href= "link10.html">有些族裔更平等？</a><br><br>

With that, my colleague and I are happy to take your questions. <br><br>
Q My first question is, can you just make sure we all understand exactly what was redacted here? Were these names of government agents, that is, individuals, or just the countries they came from? <br><br>
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Neither. They are foreign government services. As you can see, all three of them, the black mark comes before the word "service." They're not the names of agents or the countries they come from; it's just from a particular foreign government service, meaning intelligence service. <br><br>
Q Okay. And what did the President say when he received this? Did he ask any questions? What was his reaction? <br><br>
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I don't have any information on that. I don't think either one of us were in the room for that. <br><br>
Q Could you check on that for me? <br><br>
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Sure. <br><br>
Q Thank you. <br><br>
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Actually, can I go back to the last question. I think we will not take that question, because that's not the sort of thing that we would discuss, is the interaction between the President and his briefer. That's a confidential relationship between the briefer who briefs the President each morning and the President. So not only do we not know, but it's not the sort of thing that we would discuss. <br><br>
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Right. <br><br>
Q On these surveillance of federal buildings in New York, can you tell me when that surveillance took place, when the FBI interviewed the men, and whether that determination that it was consistent with tourist activity was prior to 9/11? <br><br>
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: We can provide you a little bit on that, but we don't have all of the details here. That was in the spring of 2001. It was checked out subsequently by the FBI and determined to be activity that was tourist-related, people simply taking pictures of buildings in New York. <br><br>
Q Can you be more specific about when "subsequently" was? Presumably it was after August 6th. <br><br>
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: After August 6th; I don't have more information on that. <br><br>
Q Thank you for doing this. I'm curious about the line, "the FBI is conducting approximately 70 full field investigations throughout the U.S. that it considers bin Laden-related." Can you elaborate on those investigations? And what would have been the criteria for the FBI to consider one of its investigations bin Laden-related? <br><br>
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: We certainly wouldn't comment on FBI investigations. Something -- I'll leave it at that. 
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I think the answer actually is, we don't have information on that. That would be the -- the FBI was simply letting the President know that they had 70 investigations, but we didn't have the details, and we don't have the details. They could be any kinds of investigations, criminal investigations or intelligence investigations and, in some way, bin Laden-related. But we don't have any more information. <br><br>
Q Thank you. <br><br>
Q Thank you all for doing this. The essence of Condi's testimony the other day was that at the end of this briefing, there was nothing actionable by the President for -- by her or anybody else. But if I understand what you've said is that even though they weren't related to September 11th, these two events, both the federal buildings surveillance and the threat in the UAE, were not resolved at the time that this briefing happened. So it makes me wonder -- and this gets back to how the President reacted -- whether or not he indicated at that time any concern about that, or any renewed effort that he wanted done to find these cells in the United States. <br><br>
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: We can't give you any information about the President's reaction. We don't know the President's reaction, and it would not be the sort of thing that we would discuss. But with respect to, one, the President is told, in fact, that the FBI and the CIA are investigating the call to the embassy. So that's what would be, in fact, done. And with respect to the first one, that one was being -- was being checked out. <br><br>
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Can I also address the second -- I just want to point out that, as I've said before, that the agencies were aggressively investigating this call. Again, I remind you that on May 17th of 2001, the NSC counterterrorism staff convened the CSG, the Counterterrorism Security Group: that includes the State Department, Department of Defense, JCS, Department of Justice, FBI, CIA. And they reviewed this. This was also shared with customs, INS, and FAA. So this was being aggressively pursued. <br><br>
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Let me actually add one more thing to that, which is that the kinds of responses that one would normally take to this sort of activity, had it been, in fact, suspicious, even though we -- it had turned out later that it, in fact, was not related to 9/11 -- but the kinds of activity that you would take to respond, in fact, were already being taken. Both FAA and FBI had issued warnings with respect to possible hijackings to free incarcerated terrorists, and to be on the alert for attacks in the event of convictions or other law enforcement actions, and in addition, the FBI was investigating, in particular, this particular attack. So the sorts of things that one would do to respond to these things if they, in fact, amounted to anything were already being done. <br><br>
Q And do I remember correctly -- I don't have Condi's testimony right in front of me -- that she was asked at one point on Thursday, was she ever made aware of cells operating in the United States; I believe she said that, no, she was not. <br><br>
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: No, I don't. You can go back and check her transcript, David, but I think she said, in fact, that it was mentioned by Dick Clarke in the transition, essentially in passing, that this was something that was -- had been determined as a result of the Millennium, that there were al Qaeda affiliates in the United States, but that that was simply factual information that had been provided. It was not something that was being recommended as far as an action item, something that needed to be done. <br><br>
Q But she thought, again, obviously, when she read -- <br><br>
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Right. <br><br>
Q Okay. Had she seen it anytime between those two? <br><br>
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I couldn't speak to that. I don't believe so. <br><br>
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Hey, David, I just want to put a point on the two incidents you raised. Also, again, I'll just repeat that there was no information that either incident was related to the attacks of September 11th. It's important that we keep going back to remember that. <br><br>
Q Yes, but that's retrospective. I mean, you know, at the time you didn't know what kind of attack you were going to have. So whether it was related to September 11th or not, this does not inform the President of whether there was enough being done, based on these threats. <br><br>
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I will remind you, I think, where you are heading on that, David, is the recommendations that we were getting as far as action items that needed to be taken were focused not at activity in the United States, but at activity outside the United States. Things like going into Afghanistan, or the Predator, or other things. This was not on the list of recommended actions of -- in fact, I think as you heard Sandy Berger say when he got this question about the possible cells in the United States -- he got this question in the hearing, and he said that this was being followed up by the FBI, which is exactly what this memo says, is that the FBI is conducting 70 investigations. <br><br>
Q I know you don't want to go into the President's reaction, but can you tell us whether he read the PDB, the article, or whether he was briefed on it? <br><br>
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: We don't have any information on that. I actually just don't know the answer to that. The norm would be that he has both, that he was given the book and reads it, and the briefer may provide -- may answer questions or provide additional detail. But that's simply a normal process over all of the briefings that the President takes. The President likes an interactive process for his briefer. As you know, it's something that he revived, because he's very interested in intelligence, at the beginning of his term, he revived the practice of actually having a long intelligence briefing in the morning with his DCI present, so that he could have interaction with the briefer, to both read the material, get additional color on it from either the DCI or the briefer, and to be able to ask questions. But as far as what happened in this particular incident, I don't think we have anything on that for you. <br><br>
Q He was in Crawford at the time, I believe -- correct me if I'm wrong -- <br><br>
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Correct. <br><br>
Q Was he briefed in person? <br><br>
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: He was briefed in person. <br><br>
Q And it was on -- he was actually briefed on August 6th, is that right? <br><br>
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Correct. <br><br>
Q And a second question -- you've said a number of times that none of the threats described in this PDB had anything to do with 9/11, but they involved parts of the same network of terrorists, did they not? <br><br>
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Again, I don't think, going back to Osama bin Laden's public statements -- he said publicly in '97 and '98 that his followers should try to "bring the fighting to America." I don't think it's a surprise to anyone looking at the history of that organization that they wanted to attack our country. I mean -- and as I said before, as the PDB notes, the presence of people and individuals associated or affiliated with al Qaeda in the U.S. wasn't new information. This had been well-known in the intelligence and law enforcement communities for a number of years. So I don't understand your question, given the facts of the matter. <br><br>
Q Well, I wonder if you could explain how you know that none of these had anything to do with any of the personnel involved in September 11th. <br><br>
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, the two -- almost all of the information in this piece is historical. There are 17 sentences in the piece; 14 of the sentences relate to historical information or previous incidents. The 15th sentence says, the FBI is conducting current investigations. The other two are things that were closer to the present time -- the one about the possible surveillance and the one about the unidentified caller. Those two were checked out and neither of them was determined to have had any ties to 9/11. The two Yemenis were determined to be tourist related photographs. And we could not find any connection between the information that was provided by the caller to the UIE and September 11th. <br><br>
So I think that's what my colleague means is that there's -- for all of these other 14 things in there that -- they're part of al Qaeda and we know that al Qaeda did this to us, it's all part -- maybe all part of one organization. But there's nothing in here that we can show was tied to the 9/11 plot. <br><br>
Q Thank you. <br><br>
Q Is this the only PDB in which al Qaeda is mentioned, or are there others? <br><br>
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: No, there are more than 40 over the period that the President was briefed, from the time he took office to September 11th. The al Qaeda was regularly mentioned to the President and the various things that they were doing. That was what prompted the President's comment to Dr. Rice in May that, "I am tired of swatting at flies," because the PDBs would indicate they are here, they are there, they're in this country, they're in that country. And the DCI would generally tell him the things that were being done to address these different al Qaeda operations in different countries. And that is when the President responded, "I am tired of swatting at flies." And Dr. Rice said, "We are preparing a comprehensive strategy for you to do something about them." <br><br>
Q And just to follow up, if this is -- even a fair amount of it is reviewing ground that was well-known in intel circles about al Qaeda, it's still got a fairly alarmist tone to this PDB. And why is -- if I'm hearing you right, the only thing that's really done in reaction to this is this May 17th joint counterterror meeting. I mean, what else really, in terms of the tree shaking bit, Dr. Rice kind of disparaged at the testimony, what else really gets done after this? <br><br>
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, that's an easy one. Remember, this is basically coming at the end of an extremely long spring and summer period where the administration really has been at battle stations and is doing something absolutely every day. We have issued -- State Department has issued warnings, the Defense Department has issued warnings, the FAA has issued numerous warnings, the FBI has issued numerous warnings, the CSG is meeting almost every day, sometimes twice a day. The President is discussing this with the DCI and with Dr. Rice in his office every morning when the issue comes up. Dr. Rice is talking about it each morning in her phone calls with the Secretaries of State and the Secretary of Defense. She's talking about it with the DCI. There are -- the Vice President, members of the NSC staff and the DCI are making phone calls to foreign intelligence services, to foreign leaders saying, get us anything you have. The CIA is telling all of its chiefs of station around the world, be on the highest levels of alert, send us any information that you've got. <br><br>
So this is not the only thing that is being done. This is sort of at the end of the summer when, in fact, people have been told that it looks like things may be petering off and the President asks this question. This is what this has been prepared -- been prepared in response to. But this is after a long spring and summer of an extremely heightened level of alert and activity. <br><br>
And then just one last point. On the UAE call, it's not that the only thing that was done was to have a meeting; that was just -- the point there was simply that within -- that the call was made on the 15th; CIA reported the information on the 16th. As soon as the information was received, the counterterrorism staff here immediately convened a meeting to review it to make sure that everybody was aware of it. And then, there's a long chronology which we didn't put in here of about 12 or 15 steps of actions that were taken by CIA or other agencies to run down the information on this particular report and the names that were mentioned in it. <br><br>
Q Right, so this really did raise the sense of urgency. It was -- <br><br>
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I wouldn't say this raised the sense of urgency. I'm not sure what you mean by "this," but if you mean this, the piece, I'd say, the sense -- the sense of urgency had been raised starting in the May-June timetable. And, if anything, this was more sort of towards the end of the period -- in fact, the intelligence that had been coming in at this point was more that whatever seemed to be coming seemed to have been put off. <br><br>
Q Right. But this is more -- in other words, was this different in kind than previous reports, or was this -- <br><br>
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: You have to keep going back to the point -- again, I have to remind you -- the threat data was showing threats overseas. This piece you have was brought to the President at the President's request. You have to keep going back to remember that fact. <br><br>
Q Okay, thank you. <br><br>
Q Hi, gentlemen. Thank you. You'll have to forgive me, looking for a little bit of background and context for those of us who don't read Presidential Daily Briefings on a regular basis. I'm just a little surprised that so much of this is -- that there's a classified document the President sees every morning that is mostly made up of information that is publicly already known. Is that what PDBs usually consist of? <br><br>
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Do I sense a little bit of irony in your tone? (Laughter.) <br><br>
Q Perhaps. (Laughter.) <br><br>
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Let me tell you something. One of the biggest issues in intelligence collection and analysis these days is how much information is simply publicly available that can be used and analyzed, and how much information comes from clandestine sources. And there's a whole cottage industry of people out there who, in fact, say, look, if you spend enough time simply analyzing -- collecting, analyzing, compiling the open-source intelligence, you can tell a lot. <br><br>
So, in fact, the PDB items and all intelligence items are almost always a combination of clandestine information from human sources, signals, intelligence, other kinds of sources, as well as open stuff. And so this was telling the President -- which might not necessarily be in the front of everybody's mind, that, in fact, bin Laden -- you've asked, is bin Laden interested in hitting the U.S. Yes, Mr. President, he has, in fact, he said it publicly in 1997 and 1998, and has issued fatwas and has declared his intent to strike the U.S. <br><br>
So much of the information in here, yes, is classified, highly classified. But the fact that bin Laden was interested in hitting the U.S. is, in fact -- really should not have come as a surprise to people. <br><br>
Q I guess I don't understand what's highly classified if it's publicly already well-known. Those seem like oxymorons to me. 
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, it's a mix of information. The fact that bin Laden was interested in hitting the U.S. was publicly known. The details of some of the things that are in this report, of things that were said by individual terrorists were, in fact, highly classified at the time because they came from intelligence sources. <br><br>
Q Thank you so much. <br><br>
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I would just point out, as you note on there, the parts that are redacted -- which are the names of foreign governments that we work closely with, obviously, to provide information to our government -- that helps answer your question further, I think. <br><br>
Q Thank you, yes. <br><br>
Q Gentlemen, how are you? <br><br>
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Fine. <br><br>
Q Thank you very much. My question is, after the warnings went out from the various government agencies, do you know what, specifically, they did, beyond issuing the warnings. For example, what did the FAA have airports do, in terms of airport security personnel? And what specifically, beyond -- did the FBI report back on the results of their investigations? <br><br>
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: You would have to check with them on the details of that. I don't, sitting here, know the answers to that. <br><br>
Q Thank you. <br><br>
Q I apologize if you already answered this, but I don't think you did. I was trying to figure out if the President -- having requested this information in the first place, then requested a follow-up on the caller to the UAE and to the people who had been doing the surveillance? <br><br>
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Don't have any information for you on the President's specific reactions to this piece. <br><br>
Q Okay. If he didn't request it, was he later informed about the follow-up to those two pieces of information? <br><br>
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, I didn't say he didn't request it, I said we don't have any information for you on what he requested or what he didn't request. <br><br>
Q Was there any follow-up to those two questions that was reported back to the White House? <br><br>
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: As I mentioned earlier, on the UAE piece there had been -- in fact, the White House had convened a meeting on the UAE caller and called in all the different government agencies to make sure they were aware of the information and that it was being shared. <br><br>
Q And then once it was determined that it was not a threat, was that then passed back to the White House? What was the process there? And the same with the surveillance Yemeni guys. <br><br>
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I don't have any information for you on that. I don't know the answer. <br><br>
Q So how should we characterize -- it seems, then, that that sounds like a loose end, that it never doubled back to the White House. I mean, it doesn't sound as though, then, it was resolved. <br><br>
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, I think they were resolved. In the first case, the FBI went and checked out the information and determined that it was tourist information. On the second, the CIA and FBI and a bunch of other agencies investigated it from the President's point of view, which is what I think you're asking. He was aware, in the case of the UAE call, that CIA and FBI are investigating it. In fact, there are lots of call-ins to embassies. I can tell you, it's like in the United States, people who call in to police stations. There are hundreds, if not more -- you'd have to check with CIA -- of call-ins to embassies. And the mere fact of a call-in to an embassy about a threat is not particularly alarming. The President is told that FBI and CIA are investigating it. <br><br>
Q Let me ask you about that, then. How unusual was it that there was this meeting convened at the White House after that call? How often does that usually happen upon notice of a threat? <br><br>
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: That happens fairly regularly during a period of a threat spike like this, where everybody is on high alert and they go and check out -- they go and check out everything. I think that's, in fact, why something like this would be put in this report. I think -- anticipating your question of why, if there are lots of call-ins to embassies why was it put in here; and, in fact, we asked the people who prepared that and the answer is, even though there are lots and lots of call-ins, I don't think this stuck out any more than others, other than that this piece overall was about information about bin Laden's interest in striking the U.S. And that was a relevant piece of information, but it was not necessarily any more credible than any others. <br><br>
Q Got it. Thank you. <br><br>
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: All right, I think we'll take one more. <br><br>
Q Just to follow up on that one. If you say the investigation started in May and this is in August, am I to assume that it hadn't been concluded by August? <br><br>
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I don't think it was concluded by August. Unless things are absolutely put to bed one way or another, they are left open. After September 11th, as you know, people have scrubbed back through every shred of information and we were not able to determine that there was any linkage between the information that this caller made and involvement in September 11th. <br><br>
Q And just to sort of round one thing up, you mentioned earlier about patterns of suspicious activity and cited one. What other patterns? I mean, this is July -- in July you have the Phoenix memo and you have some other things popping up. <br><br>
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Glad you asked that question, because I think that's one of the things that is, in fact, somewhat difficult to understand here, which is, what are the patterns of suspicious activity? Let me just reemphasize something that my colleague said, is that the patterns of suspicious activity here are not patterns based on FBI investigative observations, other than the one observation of the surveillance of buildings. The pattern was the CIA analyst's judgment that if you connect -- having talked to the FBI analysts -- that if you connect the threat spike overall with the information from the East Africa defendant that bin Laden might be interested in retaliating if people were convicted, and, in fact, they had just been convicted, and that people had recently been seen surveilling the courthouse where they, in fact, had been convicted, even though -- although she did not know it at this time -- that this surveillance turned out to be tourist-related; that if, in her judgment, if you connected those dots, that seemed to be a pattern of possibly suspicious activity in this country. <br><br>
But just to be clear here, this was not based on FBI information -- FBI observations of patterns of suspicious activity derived from their investigative observations, other than that one of surveillance of the courthouse later determined to be tourist-related. <br><br>
Q But to put it a different way, to prepare this paper, no one went back to the FBI to ask for all the information they had relative to potential hijacking? <br><br>
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: The analyst called -- the CIA analyst called an FBI analyst for information that would be relevant. And the FBI analyst provided the information that we just described to you. 
Q Right. Okay. Thank. <br><br>
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Okay, everybody, well, thank you. Appreciate the good questions, and we'll talk to you soon. <br><br>

《总统每日简报》<br><br>
《总统每日简报》什么时候开始出现的现在由于外界缺少详细的信息还不太清楚，但是至少自福特总统以来就存在了。《总统每日简报》是一本蓝色的三环活页笔记本，封页上印着“总统每日简报”。内容是中央情报局认为在过去24小时发生的最重要的事情和信息，包括针对美国的潜在恐怖威胁以及外国领导人的身体状况等。曾担任克林顿总统首任中央情报局局长的詹姆斯 沃尔西称：“如果有什么新的、令人兴奋的以及重要的事情，这都是《总统每日简报》的主要内容，就像是报纸的头版。”<br><br>
据说，《总统每日简报》由中央情报局的一位汇报者和局长于每天上午8时送到总统的办公室。通常情况下，这个时候会有另外三个人在场，副总统、国家安全顾问以及白宫幕僚长。他们会得到这份简报的复印本，另外国务卿和国防部长也有一份。据说，有权看到这份简报的人不超过10个，等他们看完之后，这些复印本将会被带回，送到中央情报局总部。<br><br>
